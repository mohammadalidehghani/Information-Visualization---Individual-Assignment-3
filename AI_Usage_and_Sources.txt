I used ChatGPT mainly as a coding assistant for this project. The conceptual ideas behind the visualization including the decision to compare smoking prevalence and drug experimentation, as well as the choice to use a grouped bar chart were fully my own. These decisions were based on the structure of the dataset and what I considered the most meaningful way to present the information.

ChatGPT supported me in the following ways:

1. Code generation and implementation

Helped me write the D3.js code, including setting up the grouped bar chart, loading the dataset, and creating interactions such as tooltips, hover highlighting, and animations.

2. Code debugging and improvement

Assisted in identifying issues in early versions of the script and provided suggestions to improve transitions, event handling, and general code structure.

While I relied on ChatGPT for technical coding support, all visualization decisions, interpretations, and design choices were made by me.
